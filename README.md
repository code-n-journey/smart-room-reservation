Smart Room Reservation with AI Assistant

This project is a creative Python application inspired by the idea of cozy, colorful rooms where each guest can reserve their own personal space.
Every room has:

A unique color theme (representing culture and vibe).

A small personal library for reading.

A personal AI assistant that you can chat with about books, dramas, or anything you love.

A food ordering button for requesting meals.


ðŸš€ Features

Reserve a room by its unique color.

Chat with a simple AI assistant inside your room.

Expandable to include food ordering, cultural themes, and multi-floor design.


ðŸ›  Technologies

Python 3

JSON for room storage

Simple AI chatbot (basic NLP)

(Optional) Tkinter / Flask for graphical or web interface


ðŸ“– Future Plans

Add GUI for colorful room selection.

Connect to a real AI API for more advanced conversations.

Implement database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for storing reservations.

Add cultural themes for each room (colors, books, decorations).


ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

This project is based on a dream:
A salon with 20 cozy rooms across two floors, each with its own color, culture, garden, library, and AI assistant.
